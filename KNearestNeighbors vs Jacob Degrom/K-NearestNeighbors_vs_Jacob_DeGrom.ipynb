    "For this mini project, I'm going to use pitching data from Major League Baseball. In Baseball, there is a concept called \"tipping pitches\", which means that some pitchers are prone to **unintentionally** telegraphing *which* type of pitch they are about to throw. Knowing what kind of pitch is coming can be invaluable information to a batter, as it can assist them in timing their swing better, or help them better decide if they want to swing at all. The best pitchers very rarely show any difference between their pitch types, as deception is key in getting batters out. Let's see if KNN can do better than the human eye and properly predict what pitch is coming based on some measured attributes prior to the release of the ball, namely: release position on an x axis, y axis, z axis, and release speed. Many other attributes exist in this dataset, but they might provide an unfair insight that would be impossible to react to in the moment, so they will be discarded.\n",
