# Data-Science-Mini-Projects
Various projects for practicing different methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Clustering, Naive Bayes for Natural Language Processing, and Random Forests.

## Topics
- KNearestNeighbors - Predicting Baseball Pitches by Release Points and Release Speed. Can KNN find if a pitcher tips their pitches?
- Naive Bayes - Used a multinomial NB model to classify offensive tweets. Warning: there is a lot of offensive language in the dataset.
- Clustering, Logistic Regreression - Used both methods to learn from a dataset related to heart failure.
- Linear Regression - used simple Linear Regression to determine Launch Speed using MLB's Statcast data. Not very promising results, and very minimally explained compared to the others. I would not put much stock in these results myself.
- Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Predicting Autism - used both methods to distinguish Autism from PDD using various metrics.
